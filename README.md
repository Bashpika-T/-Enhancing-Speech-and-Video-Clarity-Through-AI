## ðŸš€ **How It Works**  

 uses two advanced AI models:

1. **Denoiser**:  
   - Removes unwanted background noise and isolates clear speech from noisy recordings.  
   - Based on deep learning models that identify and separate noise patterns from speech.

2. **Enhancer**:  
   - Refines the quality of speech by restoring audio distortions and enhancing the clarity and richness of the sound.  
   - Extends the bandwidth of the audio to make it sound more natural and lifelike.

Both models work together to deliver high-quality, noise-free, and enhanced speech, making the audio clearer and more intelligible, even in noisy environments.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Features**  

- **Speech Denoising**: Cleans speech from background noise, improving clarity.  
- **Audio Enhancement**: Enhances perceptual audio quality by restoring distortions and extending bandwidth.  
- **High-Quality Output**: Outputs at 44.1kHz for professional-grade audio quality.    
- **Customizable**: Train your own models using custom datasets.

## ðŸ›  **Installation**  

### Install the Stable Version  

```bash
pip install -Enhancing-Speech-and-Video-Clarity-Through-AI --upgrade

Enhance Audio
To enhance the speech in an audio file, use the following command:

-Enhancing-Speech-and-Video-Clarity-Through-AI in_dir out_dir

We provide a web demo powered by Gradio. Try it out here or run it locally:

python app.py

Train Your Own Model
Data Preparation
To train a custom model, you need three datasets:

Foreground Speech: Clear speech audio.
Background Noise: Non-speech background noise.
Room Impulse Response (RIR): For simulating room acoustics. You can find examples of RIR datasets.
